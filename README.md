# Toolbar Manager

Toolbar Manager for the Space Engineers game.

- Save the toolbar of your character into a file
- Load or merge your character's toolbar from a saved one
- Save the toolbars of a block (cockpit, timer) into a file
- Load or merge a block toolbar from saved one
- Move or swap toolbar items without having to recreate them
- Swap numbered toolbar "pages" for quick rearrangement

This plugin allows using a "standardized" toolbar, which greatly helps 
speeding up your builds.

It also allows loading ship cockpits quickly after building them. Just
name your groups and blocks the same way and the loaded cockpit toolbar
will work out of the box.

Try to reference blocks with their group names if possible. On loading
a block toolbar individual blocks can be referenced by name, but that 
would result in undefined behavior if the block name is not unique on 
the grid.
