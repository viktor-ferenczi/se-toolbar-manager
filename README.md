# Toolbar Manager

Toolbar Manager for the Space Engineers game.

## Features

This plugin allows for saving and loading toolbars. For example you can 
quickly load a "standard" toolbar into any game, which can greatly speed
up your builds by using toolbar slots you have already memorized.

This plugin works for both offline and online multiplayer games without
the need for any server side support. All your save files are local, 
nothing is stored on a server.

### Character toolbars

New **Save** and **Load** buttons in the bottom left corner of the **G menu**. 

- Save
- Load
- Merge
- Rename
- Delete

_Merge is the same as load, but does not clear slots not used by the toolbar loaded._

Saved toolbars are stored in XML files: `%AppData%\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\ToolbarManager`

### Planned features

These features are in the making:

- Support for block toolbars (cockpit, remote control, timer, sensor)
- Restricting the load/merge operations to certain toolbar pages
- Moving and swapping toolbar items using mouse drag&drop
- Moving toolbar items between toolbar pages
- Swapping toolbar pages

Please join the Discord (see below) and tell me which one you would use, 
so they can be fast-tracked.
