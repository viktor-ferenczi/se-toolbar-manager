# Toolbar Manager

Toolbar Manager for the Space Engineers game.

For support please [join the SE Mods Discord](https://discord.gg/PYPFPGf3Ca).

Please consider [supporting my work on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/semods).

## Features

This plugin allows for saving and loading toolbars. For example you can 
quickly load a "standard" toolbar into any game, which can greatly speed
up your builds by using toolbar slots you have already memorized.

This plugin works for both offline and online multiplayer games without
the need for any server side support. All your save files are local, 
nothing is stored on a server.

### Toolbars

The **G menu** has two new buttons to manage saved toolbars:
- Save
- Load

**Merge** is the same as **Load**, but does not clear slots not used by the toolbar loaded.

Saved toolbars are stored as XML files under: `%AppData%\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\ToolbarManager`

There are subdirectories for each toolbar type. Toolbars within the same type are compatible,
altough they may not have the same amount of slots available.

It is possible to save the toolbar from a cockpit and load into a remote control, for example.

### Quick block selection

Press the `BACKSLASH` or `PIPE` key (on English keyboard) to open the quick 
block search menu. It works the same way as the original menu, but the search 
rules are optimized to find blocks primarily by capital letters and digits:

- `AB` **Armor Blocks**
- `PB` **Programmable Block**
- `SK` **Survival Kit**
- `AT` **Atmospheric Thrusters**
- `LHT` **Large Hydrogen Thrusters**
- `211` **All 2x1x1 armor blocks**

Adding the subsequent lower case letters after an upper case one allows 
for narrowing down in case of ambiguity:

- `PH` **Parachute Hatch** and **Point Hand**
- `PHat` **Parachute Hatch** only

The order of characters must match exactly. Lower case characters and
space are skipped after a matching upper chase character or digit. 

Separating multiple search patterns by space is not supported, currently.

### Planned features
- Restricting the load/merge operations to certain toolbar pages
- Multiplying the available toolbar pages using new hotkeys and saved toolbars
- Moving and swapping toolbar items using mouse drag&drop
- Moving toolbar items between toolbar pages
- Swapping toolbar pages

Please join the Discord (see below) and tell me which one you would use, 
so they can be fast-tracked.
